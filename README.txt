A testing framework.

This is a minimal Python 3 port of a test framework, created many years ago
when it actually solved a real problem.

Since then, the framework has been taken on and improved by others. This code
is not for general use and there are no plans to enhance it. It exists in this
form in order to support testing of other things I have written. I use it
because it is easy for me.
